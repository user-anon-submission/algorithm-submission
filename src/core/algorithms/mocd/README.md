`pesa2/`.

**Original implementation**
None published. The authors' sites and GitHub were searched and no reference
source for Shi-MOCD exists, so unlike `moganet` there is no binary or result
file to check this module's numbers against. Every equation below is taken from
the paper text; every choice the paper leaves open is listed under
**Divergences**.

**Objectives**
Notation over `G = (V, E)` with `m = |E|` (`graph.edges` holds each undirected
edge exactly once, so `edges.len() == m`), a partition `C = {c_1 … c_k}`,
`l_c` the edges with both endpoints in `c` counted once, and `d_c = Σ_{i∈c}
deg(i)` (which counts every internal edge twice).

Shi Eqs. 3.5/3.6, both **minimized**:

    intra = 1 − Σ_c l_c / m           fraction of edges NOT internal to a community
    inter = Σ_c (d_c / 2m)^2          the degree-concentration (null) term

so that Newman modularity is the exact complement (Eq. 3.7):

    Q = 1 − intra − inter

The names are Shi's and they are easy to misread: `intra` is *one minus* the
internal-edge fraction, so minimizing it maximizes internal edges, and `inter`
is the null term that a single-community partition drives to 1. Fragmenting
lowers `inter` and raises `intra`; coarsening does the reverse. That is the
whole trade-off, and it is why the Pareto front spans the resolution range.

`calculate_objectives` walks node *positions*, accumulating `l_c` and `d_c` into
two `Vec` accumulators indexed by community id, and divides once at the end, so
the float value is reproducible for a given labelling. Internal edges are
counted through `NodeIndex::neighbor_candidates`, which stores both directions
of every edge; the `pos < neighbor` guard is what reduces that to one count per
edge, and it is also what drops the self-allele that `neighbor_candidates`
carries for an isolated node. Removing the guard double-counts `l_c` *and*
gives isolated nodes a phantom internal edge.

**Representation**
Locus-based adjacency (Park & Song 1998; Shi §3.1.3). A `Genome = Vec<usize>`
of length `n`: gene `p` holds a *position* `q`, read as "link position `p` to
position `q`". Positions index `NodeIndex::index_to_node`, which is
`graph.nodes_vec()` — sorted by `Graph::finalize`, so the position order is
fixed for a given graph. `NodeId`s appear only at the module boundary, where
`api.rs::labels_to_partition` zips the dense label vector back against
`nodes_vec()` by position.

`NodeIndex::neighbor_candidates[p]` is the set of legal alleles for position
`p`: its neighbours, or `[p]` itself when it has none. Initialization draws
from that set and both operators redraw from it, so **every genome is legal by
construction and no repair pass exists**. The self-allele is the only
self-referential gene and only an isolated node ever holds it; such a node
becomes a singleton community and `normalize_community_ids` reports it as `-1`.

`decode` is a union-find over the `n` links followed by a relabelling pass that
assigns community ids `0..k` in ascending-position first-seen order, so two
genomes encoding the same partition decode to the identical label array. Shi
describes a backtracking decode; the components are the same set either way.

**Algorithm**
PESA-II keeps two populations: an internal population `IP` of size `ipsize`
that is regenerated every cycle, and an external archive `EP` of capacity
`epsize` that holds the non-dominated set found so far. `EP` is both the result
and the mating pool.

1. `NodeIndex::build` freezes the node order and the neighbour-position lists;
   per-position degrees are read once into a dense `Vec`.
2. `seed_archive` — `ipsize` random legal genomes, decoded and evaluated into
   `[intra, inter]`; each is offered to `EP` through `insert_nondominated`, then
   `EP` is truncated to `epsize`.
3. Per generation `0 .. num_gens−1`, stopping early if `EP` empties:
   a. `assign_cells` bins `EP` into a `GRID_DIVISIONS^2` hyper-grid, every axis
      normalized to the range `EP` *currently* spans, and rebuilds the per-cell
      occupancy `occ` — the squeeze factors. The grid is adaptive: it is rebuilt
      from scratch each time `EP` changes.
   b. `breed_child`, `ipsize` times. With probability `cross_rate` the child is
      a `uniform_crossover` of two parents, otherwise a clone of one; every
      parent comes from `squeeze_tournament`. `mutate` is then applied to every
      child, crossed or cloned.
   c. Evaluate the children and offer each to `EP` via `insert_nondominated`.
   d. If `EP` overflows, `truncate` back to `epsize`.
4. `evolutionary_phase` returns `EP` as the Pareto front.

`squeeze_tournament` is PESA-II's region-based selection and the piece most
often reduced to plain tournament selection: it draws **two occupied cells**,
keeps the one with the lower squeeze factor (ties by coin flip), and only then
draws a member uniformly from inside the winner. A cell with one member beats a
cell with twenty regardless of how good those twenty are, which is what spreads
the archive along the front.

`truncate` is the mirror image: repeatedly pick a most-crowded cell (ties
uniformly), drop a uniformly random member of it, and **rebuild the grid**
before the next removal, until `|EP| == epsize`. `insert_nondominated` rejects a
candidate only if some `EP` member *dominates* it, so objective-wise duplicates
accumulate freely; truncation is what bounds them.

Model selection — the two entry points:

- **MOCD-Q** (Eq. 3.8) — the front member of maximum `Q`. Since
  `Q = 1 − intra − inter`, that is `argmin(intra + inter)`. This selector lives
  in `api/detectors.rs::mocd_q_fn`, **not** in this module; the module only
  produces the front via `Mocd::generate_pareto_front`.
- **MOCD-D** (Eqs. 3.9–3.11) — `Mocd::run`. Generate `rand_networks`
  Erdős–Rényi control graphs of the same scale, evolve a full front on each,
  and return the real front member whose `(intra, inter)` point is furthest from
  all of them: for each real solution take the minimum Euclidean distance to any
  control-front member (over every control front), then keep the solution whose
  minimum is largest. The idea is that a random graph's front is what "no
  community structure" looks like in objective space, so the most deviant real
  point is the most structurally meaningful one.

**Parameters**
`Mocd::new` (constructor arguments; `Mocd` itself is not registered with the
Python module — see **Known issues**):

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `debug_level` | 0 | `0` silent; `≥1` prints the graph once and the `EP` size every generation. |
| `rand_networks` | 3 | MOCD-D control fronts. Read only by `run()`; ignored by `generate_pareto_front()`. Each one costs a **full** evolutionary run. |
| `pop_size` | 100 | PESA-II `ipsize`. Floored at 1 internally. |
| `num_gens` | 100 | Generations. `0` returns the seeded archive. |
| `cross_rate` | 0.6 | Probability a child is a crossover rather than a parent clone. |
| `mut_rate` | 0.4 | Per-gene probability of redrawing the allele from the position's neighbours. |

`cross_rate = 0.6` / `mut_rate = 0.4` are Shi Table 1: *"pc and pm are 0.6 and
0.4 for these four EA based algorithms"* — fixed across every experiment in the
paper. `rand_networks = 3` is Shi §3.2, which generates three control fronts for
the artificial networks (the timed real-network runs use one).

The Python wrappers `anonlib.mocd_q` / `anonlib.mocd_d` do **not** use those
defaults. They pass `BENCH_CROSS_RATE = 0.9` and `BENCH_MUT_RATE = 0.1`, the
HP-MOCD benchmark budget (Santos et al. 2025), so that the baseline is compared
under the same settings as the rest of the repository. To reproduce Shi's
published configuration, pass `cross_rate=0.6, mut_rate=0.4` explicitly along
with the per-graph `ipsize`/`epsize`/generation counts from Shi Table 1.

Internal constants a reader will hit:

| Constant | Value | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EPSIZE_CAP` | 100 | `defaults.rs` | Upper bound on the derived `ep_size`. |
| `MOCD_D_RAND_NETWORKS` | 3 | `defaults.rs` | Control-front count for the `mocd_d` wrapper. |
| `GRID_DIVISIONS` | 8 | `pesa2/grid.rs` | Hyper-grid bins per objective axis, so 64 cells for two objectives. |

`epsize` is **not** a public parameter. It is derived once in `Mocd::new` as
`pop_size.clamp(1, EPSIZE_CAP)`, i.e. `min(pop_size, 100)` with a floor of 1.
Shi Table 1 assigns `ipsize`/`epsize`/generations per graph and tops out at
`epsize = 100`, though §4.1.2 runs `epsize = 200`; the cap encodes the table,
not §4.1.2, and there is no way to reach 200 through the public API.

**Determinism**
**Nondeterministic: two consecutive calls can differ.** `evolutionary_phase`
and `generate_random_networks` both draw from `rand::rng()`, the thread-local
generator, which is seeded from the OS and is neither exposed nor re-seedable
through the public API; there is no seed parameter. Everything downstream is
order-fixed — a sorted node order, `Vec` accumulators, first-seen relabelling,
a single-threaded loop, no rayon anywhere — so the RNG stream is the only source
of run-to-run variation.

Measured on karate over 30 runs: `mocd_q` AMI 0.2450 ± 0.0112, k = 4.00
(reference distribution); `mocd_d` AMI 0.2898 ± 0.0402, k = 2.80 ± 1.60.
MOCD-D is markedly the noisier of the two, because its answer depends on
`rand_networks` freshly drawn random graphs as well as on its own front. On
florentine over 20 runs `mocd_d` returns k ∈ {2, 3, 4, 7} (10/7/2/1) while
`mocd_q` returns k = 3 every time — the spread is the control fronts, not the
search.

The *selected* partition is nevertheless stable on small graphs even though the
search is not: across independent builds and runs, `mocd_q` reproduces
byte-identical output on karate, florentine and a two-clique graph with isolated
nodes, and only diverges on lesmis. That is the objective landscape of a small
graph, not determinism — treat those three digests as a regression gate, never
as a guarantee.

**Divergences**
No reference implementation exists, so these are deliberate readings of, or
departures from, the paper text:

- **"Uniform two-point crossover" is implemented as per-gene uniform
  crossover.** Shi names the operator that way but describes it functionally as
  an independent per-position choice between the two parents, which is uniform
  crossover, not classic two-segment crossover. Either reading is safe for this
  encoding — an allele inherited at its own position is legal in either parent —
  so the functional description was followed over the name.
- **Union-find decode instead of the paper's backtracking.** Same connected
  components, so the same partition; only the identifiers differ, and those are
  compacted to first-seen order anyway.
- **The MOCD-D null model is Erdős–Rényi `G(n, m)`**, uniformly random simple
  edges over the same node set with the same edge count — Shi's "random networks
  with the same scale" (§3.2). A degree-preserving null (double-edge-swap) was
  considered and rejected: it is a stronger control, but it is not what the
  paper describes, and MOCD-D's decision rule is calibrated against the weaker
  one. All `n` nodes are pre-inserted into the control graph before any edge is
  added, so an isolated node in the original stays a node of the control graph
  and `n` matches; dropping that pre-insertion silently shrinks the control
  graph and shifts the whole control front.
- **Control fronts get the FULL evolutionary budget.** Each of the
  `rand_networks` control runs uses the same `num_gens`/`pop_size`/`ep_size` as
  the real run, so `mocd_d` costs `rand_networks + 1` full searches. This looks
  like an obvious place to economize and is not: an under-evolved random front
  never reaches the fragmented region, which makes the *real* front's fragmented
  extreme look spuriously deviant and hands MOCD-D the wrong answer.
- **No shared engine, no rayon.** PESA-II is reimplemented inside this module
  and runs single-threaded, rather than reusing the project's shared NSGA-II /
  NSGA-III machinery, so this baseline's runtime tracks the published
  single-threaded method rather than the repository's optimizations. Hot-path
  state is dense `Vec`-indexed; the shared `Partition` map is built only at the
  API boundary.
- **`epsize` is derived, not exposed** (see **Parameters**), and the wrapper
  functions ship the HP-MOCD benchmark rates rather than Shi's.
- **MOCD-Q lives outside this module.** The max-`Q` argmin is in
  `api/detectors.rs`; the module surface stops at the front. MOCD-D, which needs
  the control-front machinery, is `Mocd::run` here.

**Known issues**
Recorded, deliberately **not** fixed — behaviour is frozen for this module.

- **`mocd_q` raises `RuntimeError("MOCD-Q produced an empty front")` on an empty
  graph and on a single-node graph.** `evolutionary_phase` returns an empty
  archive whenever the graph has no nodes *or* no edges, and the wrapper turns
  the empty front into an error. Any edgeless graph, not just those two, hits it.
- **`mocd_d` *panics* on the same inputs.** `min_max_selection` ends in
  `.expect("Real Pareto front is empty.")`, which surfaces in Python as
  `pyo3_runtime.PanicException`. That is not the `RuntimeError` its sibling
  raises, and because `PanicException` derives from `BaseException` a caller's
  `except Exception` will not catch it.
- **`rand_networks = 0` degenerates silently.** With no control fronts, the fold
  over an empty `random_fronts` leaves every solution scoring `f64::MAX`, the
  strict `>` never fires again, and `run()` returns the *first* member of the
  front — an arbitrary partition, not a selected one. Not reachable from
  `anonlib.mocd_d` (default 3), but reachable through `Mocd::new(.., 0, ..)`.
- **`Mocd` is a `#[pyclass]` that is never registered** with the Python module
  in `lib.rs`, so it cannot be constructed from Python. `anonlib.mocd_q` and
  `anonlib.mocd_d` are the only entry points, and there is no `mocd_fronts`
  exposing `generate_pareto_front` the way the other detectors expose theirs.
- **`Mocd::envolve` is a misspelling of "evolve".** Left alone because the
  method is part of the module's recorded Rust surface.
- **`calculate_objectives`'s `total_edges == 0` early return is unreachable**
  from the live path — `evolutionary_phase` rejects edgeless graphs before any
  evaluation happens. It is defensive only.
