/// everything between communities share one:
///
/// ```text
/// A_ij ~ Poisson(k_i k_j omega_c)   inside community c
/// A_ij ~ Poisson(k_i k_j omega_out) between communities
/// ```
///
/// Profiling out the densities leaves a log-likelihood ratio against the
/// configuration model that is a sum of two bincounts:
///
/// ```text
/// L(C) = sum_c e_c ln(e_c / E_c)  +  e_out ln(e_out / E_out)
/// E_c  = d_c^2 / 4m,   E_out = m - sum_c E_c
/// ```
///
/// `E_c` is the number of intra-community edges the configuration model expects,
/// so `L` is exactly how many nats of edge placement the partition explains that
/// the degrees alone do not. Each community brings a free density, so the
/// densities are charged the Schwarz penalty: half a nat per parameter per log
/// observation, over the `B + 1` densities and the graph's `2m` edge endpoints.
/// `B` counts the communities holding at least one non-isolated vertex, because
/// `load` skips degree-zero vertices entirely.
///
/// ```text
/// score(C) = L(C) - (B + 1) / 2 * ln(2m)
/// ```
///
/// Note that `L` does NOT rise monotonically with `B`. That holds for the
/// unrestricted block model, where a refinement's model nests the coarser one;
/// here it does not, because splitting a community moves the pairs it sheds off
/// its own free density and onto the single shared `omega_out`. The test
/// `splitting_a_clique_is_not_worth_the_extra_density` is the case: the
/// refinement's `L` is lower than the planted partition's before any penalty.
///
/// Both degenerate partitions lose, neither by a special case. One community
/// gives `e_1 = m` and `E_1 = m`, so `L = 0` and the score is `-ln(2m)`. All
/// singletons give `e_c = 0` everywhere, so `edges_in = 0` while `expect_in > 0`,
/// and the assortativity guard below rejects the partition outright. There is no
/// degeneracy filter and no fallback stage.
///
/// One caveat on a candidate set this module did not produce: if EVERY candidate
/// is at or below chance they all score `NEG_INFINITY`, and `select_index` then
/// returns the lowest index rather than signalling. A CPM front always carries the
/// one-community member, whose score is the finite `-ln(2m)`, so `rimpso` and
/// `rimpso_fronts` never reach that branch; `rimpso_select` can.
