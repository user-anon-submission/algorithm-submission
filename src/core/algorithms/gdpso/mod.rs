//! GDPSO — Greedy Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (Cai, Gong, Ma, Ruan,
//! Yuan, Jiao, Information Sciences 316:503-516, 2015). Newman-Girvan
//! modularity is the single maximised objective, so there is no Pareto front
//! and no `gdpso_fronts` entry point. The method, its parameters and its
//! divergences from the reference are documented in `README.md`.
//!
//! Written from a clean-room description of the authors' reference
//! implementation; no reference source was read while writing this module.
