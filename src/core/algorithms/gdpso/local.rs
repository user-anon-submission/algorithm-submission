/// Apply a move mask: every masked node, in increasing index order and in
/// place, takes the neighbouring community with the largest modularity gain,
/// and only when that gain is strictly positive. `ws.sigma` must hold the
/// community degree sums of `labels` on entry and is kept in step with every
/// accepted move. Being in place makes the sweep Gauss-Seidel: node `i` sees
/// the moves already made by smaller indices. Only a node's own neighbours are
/// ever candidates, so no node is ever moved into a fresh singleton.
